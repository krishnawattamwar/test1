Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.  You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Juvenescence are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\").  The Notice to Juvenescence should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:Legal@JuvLabs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Legal@JuvLabs.com</a> (\"Notice Address\").  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.  If Juvenescence and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Juvenescence may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Juvenescence or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Juvenescence is entitled.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"mz-cms-block\"> <div class=\"mz-cms-content\"> <div id=\"rich-text-container-2f4ccdd7-3265-40a8-86c1-f62a43d71308\" class=\"rich-text-container copernicus header-polaris fine-detail-text-editor fine-detail-body h5-forest\" tabindex=\"0\"> <p><b>d.  Arbitration Procedures</b></p> <p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\'s (\"AAA\") rules and procedures, including the AAA\'s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the \"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  For information on the AAA, please visit its website, <a href=\"https://www.adr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.adr.org</a>.  Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA\'s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.  The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.  Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.<br><br> Unless Juvenescence and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.  If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.  If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Juvenescence agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"mz-cms-block\"> <div class=\"mz-cms-content\"> <div id=\"rich-text-container-5df7834e-26c5-4574-9dc7-0720a831ec7b\" class=\"rich-text-container copernicus header-polaris fine-detail-text-editor fine-detail-body h5-forest\" tabindex=\"0\"> <p><b>e.\tCosts of Arbitration</b><br></p> <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \"Arbitration Fees\") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.  If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Juvenescence will pay all Arbitration Fees.  If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Juvenescence will pay your portion of such fees.  In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Juvenescence will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.  Any payment of attorneys\' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.<br><br> <b>f.\tConfidentiality</b> </p> <p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.<br><br> <b>g.\tSeverability</b> </p> <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled \"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled \"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\" are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief.

Juvenescence may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice.

Juvenescence reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.</p> <br> <h5>General</h5> <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Juvenescence and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Juvenescence with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Juvenescence agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Delaware. The failure of Juvenescence to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Juvenescence, but Juvenescence may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.
